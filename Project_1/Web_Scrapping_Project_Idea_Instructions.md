# Instructions on How to Submit Your Project Idea
<br/>
Send me an e-mail (matthew.martinez@utsa.edu) and CC: Matt (matthew.angotti@my.utsa.edu) and Austin (apesina@gvec.org) with the following answered.

1. What is the research question(s) that will guide your project?
2. What data are you hoping to scrape? If you are wanting to use other datasets in conjunction with the data you will scrape then say that as well.
3. What website will you scrape from?

Please have this to me by Friday, February 11th, 2021. I will give you a simple response if the project will work and ask you follow-up questions if I have any.

Thanks.
